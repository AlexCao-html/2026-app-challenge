# ReelLife frontend + API

One Express process serves the static UI (`public/`) and the accounts/
conversation-history API. This used to be two services -- this Express app
plus a separate Python/FastAPI service in `../database` -- converged into one
so there's only one process to run. The API here is a from-scratch Node
re-implementation of `../database`'s API (kept there, unused, for reference),
not a port of its code.

Kept the same on purpose:

- table/column layout (`users`, `sessions`, `conversation`, `prompts`)
- password hashing format (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 200k iterations,
  `<saltHex>$<digestHex>`) -- a hash produced by either backend verifies
  against the other
- "one active session per user" login model (opaque bearer token stored
  server-side, not a JWT)

## Stack

- **express** -- HTTP server, both static files and the API
- **node:sqlite** (built-in, no native dependency to install/compile) --
  storage. It's still an experimental Node API, so `npm start`/`npm test`
  print an `ExperimentalWarning`; that's expected. Requires Node >= 22.5.
- **node:crypto** -- password hashing + session tokens
- **node:test** (built-in) -- the test suite, no test framework dependency

## Project layout

```
app.js            Express app: JSON body parsing, static files, the two
                   routers below, error-handling middleware
auth.js           /signup /login /logout /whoami + the requireAuth middleware
conversations.js  /conversations, /prompts
interview.js      /conversations/{id}/interview/* -- the Story tab's interview
interviewer.js    what the interviewer says: Claude on AWS Bedrock, or canned
                   questions when that isn't switched on
friends.js        /friends, /users/search -- the friend graph
stories.js        /stories -- publishing a conversation for others to read
db.js             node:sqlite connection + schema (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS)
security.js       password hashing + session token helpers
storage.js        transcript/media file helpers
errors.js         ApiError(status, message)
test/             node --test suite (auth, conversations, family, friends,
                   stories)
public/           static frontend (see below)
```

Large content -- the running conversation transcript and any attached media
-- is written to files under `MEDIA_ROOT` (default `conversation_files/`),
with only the file path stored in the database. See `storage.js`.

## Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Runs on http://localhost:6767 by default (`PORT` env var to change it).
Tables are created automatically on startup -- no migration step. Settings
can also go in `frontend/.env` (see `.env.example`), which `npm start` reads.

### Configuration (env vars)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `6767` | Port the Express app listens on |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | `./app.db` | SQLite file path |
| `MEDIA_ROOT` | `./conversation_files` | Where transcripts/media attachments are written |
| `INTERVIEW_AI` | *(unset)* | `bedrock` to have Claude run the Story tab's interview; anything else uses canned questions |
| `INTERVIEW_MODEL` | `anthropic.claude-opus-5` | Bedrock model ID for the interviewer |
| `AWS_REGION` | -- | Bedrock region, e.g. `us-east-1` (only with `INTERVIEW_AI=bedrock`) |

### Turning on the AI interviewer

The interview came over from the ReelLife repo (`src/server/server.js`,
`src/js/interview.js`), which called Claude through AWS Bedrock. It still
does, via Anthropic's `@anthropic-ai/bedrock-sdk`, but only when switched on
-- otherwise the interviewer asks from a short canned list and "Write my
story" just gathers your answers, so the app runs for anyone without AWS
access.

To switch it on for every `npm start`, do this once:

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

then open `.env` and fill in one of the AWS credential options (or leave them
out to use a profile from `aws configure`). `app.js` loads `.env` on startup,
and the log says which interviewer is running:

```
Interview AI: Claude (anthropic.claude-opus-5) on AWS Bedrock in us-east-1
```

`.env` is git-ignored, so keys never get committed. Anything set in the shell
overrides it -- `INTERVIEW_AI=off npm start` runs one session without Claude.
The tests never read `.env`. The AWS account needs Bedrock access to the model
in `INTERVIEW_MODEL`.

## Running the tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

`node --test` runs each test file in its own process, so `test/auth.test.js`
and `test/conversations.test.js` each get a fresh throwaway SQLite file and
media directory (set via `DATABASE_PATH`/`MEDIA_ROOT` at the top of the file,
before `../app` is required) -- nothing touches the real `app.db` or
`conversation_files/`.

## API

All endpoints below (except `/signup`, `/login`) require
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` from `/login`.

- `POST /signup` -- `{"username", "email", "password"}` -> `201 {"id": ...}`
- `POST /login` -- `{"email", "password"}` -> `200 {"token": ...}` (invalidates
  any previous session for that user)
- `POST /logout` -- revokes the current session token -> `200 {"ok": true}`
- `GET /whoami` -> `200 {"id", "username", "email"}`
- `POST /conversations` -> `201 {"conversation_id": ...}`
- `GET /conversations` -- list the caller's conversations
- `GET /conversations/{id}` -- a single conversation (404 if it isn't yours)
- `GET /conversations/{id}/prompts` -- that conversation's prompts, oldest first
- `POST /conversations/{id}/prompts` -- `{"content", "input_media_filename"?,
  "input_media_base64"?}` -> `201 {"prompt_id": ...}`
- `POST /prompts/{id}/response` -- `{"response", "output_media_filename"?,
  "output_media_base64"?, "cost"?}` -> `200 {"ok": true}` (adds `cost` to the
  conversation's running total)

### Interview

An interview is a conversation where the replies come from the interviewer.
Its first question is stored on the conversation (`interview_mode`,
`opening_question`); after that each prompt is one answer (`content`) and the
question asked next (`response`). Each call returns `{"question"}`; a failed
question is `502` (or `503` if Bedrock is busy), and the answer is kept.

- `POST /conversations/{id}/interview/start` -- `{"mode"}`, one of `Stages`,
  `People`, `Moments`, `Lessons` -> `201 {"mode", "question"}`. Starting again
  returns the same question (`200`).
- `POST /conversations/{id}/interview/answer` -- `{"content"}` ->
  `201 {"prompt_id", "question"}`
- `POST /conversations/{id}/interview/skip` -- replaces the latest question
  with a different one; if the latest answer never got a question, asks it
- `POST /conversations/{id}/interview/story` -> `{"story"}`, a first-person
  draft of the interview for the publish dialog. Not saved.

### Stories

A story is a published snapshot of a conversation: its text is copied into
`stories.content` when it's published, so later messages don't rewrite what
people have already read, and the conversation it came from is left alone.
`visibility` is `private` (author only), `friends` (author + accepted
friends, the Friends tab) or `public` (everyone, the Community tab).

- `POST /stories` -- `{"conversation_id", "title", "summary"?, "content"?,
  "tags"?, "place"?, "time_period"?, "photo"?, "visibility"?}` ->
  `201` with the story. `content` defaults to the author's own messages in
  that conversation (the assistant's replies are interview prompts, not the
  story). Publishing the same conversation again edits its story and returns
  `200` -- there's one story per conversation.
- `GET /stories/mine` -- the caller's own stories, newest first
- `GET /stories/friends` -- friends' stories with visibility `friends` or
  `public` (not the caller's own)
- `GET /stories/community` -- every `public` story, newest first, the
  caller's own included
- `GET /stories/{id}` -- one story with its `content`, plus `is_author` and
  `author_is_friend`; 404 if the caller isn't allowed to read it
- `PATCH /stories/{id}` -- edit any subset of the fields above (this is how
  visibility gets changed); author only
- `DELETE /stories/{id}` -- unpublish; the conversation is untouched and can
  be published again
- `GET /conversations/{id}/story` -- the story that conversation was
  published as (with `content`), or `204` if it hasn't been

Feed endpoints leave `content` out -- cards only need the title and summary,
so the full text is fetched per story.

### Friends

One row per request, in the direction it was sent, flipped to `accepted` when
the other side agrees. Declining deletes the row, so the pair can try again.

- `GET /users/search?q=` -- usernames containing `q` (never the caller, never
  anyone's email), each with `relationship`: `none`, `request_sent`,
  `request_received` or `friends`
- `GET /friends` -- accepted friends
- `GET /friends/requests` -- `{"incoming": [...], "outgoing": [...]}`, both
  still pending
- `POST /friends/requests` -- `{"username"}` -> `201` pending. Asking someone
  who already asked you accepts their request instead (`200`).
- `POST /friends/requests/{id}/accept` / `.../decline` -- addressee only
- `DELETE /friends/{userId}` -- unfriend, or cancel a request you sent

## Frontend pages

- `public/config.js` -- `API_BASE_URL` (empty string; same-origin now)
- `public/storage_api.js` -- the only place that calls the API (token storage
  + fetch wrapper); `login.html`/`index.html`'s scripts all go through it
- `public/login.html` + `loginScript.js` -- login/signup form
- `public/index.html` + `profile.js` -- profile page, guarded behind a valid
  session
- `public/index.html`'s "Story" tab + `testChat.js` -- the interview: pick a
  mode, start an interview, answer (typed or out loud), skip a question, and
  "Write my story" into the publish dialog, all through `/interview`
- `public/voiceInput.js` -- answering out loud with the browser's speech
  recognition (Chrome, Edge, Safari); dictates into the answer box with a live
  caption, and the mic button hides where it isn't supported
- `public/stories.js` -- the publish dialog above that chat, the story reader,
  and the Friends/Community feeds, all rendered from `/stories`
- `public/friends.js` -- the Friends tab's people panel (search, requests,
  friend list) on top of `/friends`
