// Claude is only called when INTERVIEW_AI=bedrock, normally set in
// frontend/.env (see .env.example), which app.js loads on `npm start`.
// Otherwise -- the default,
// and what the tests run against -- questions come from a short canned list and
// the story is just the user's own answers, which is how the Story tab behaved
// before any AI was wired up. So the app still runs for anyone on the team
// without AWS access.
//
// Bedrock credentials are whatever the AWS SDK finds: AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK,
// AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY(/AWS_SESSION_TOKEN), or a profile in
// ~/.aws. AWS_REGION picks the region.
